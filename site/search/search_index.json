We simply don\u2019t know the rules of politics or warfare in the same way that we know the rules of chess or arithmetic. The theory of probability fills this gap, allowing rigorous reasoning with uncertain information. In principle, it allows the construction of a comprehensive model of rational thought, leading from raw perceptual information to an understanding of how the world works to predictions about the future. What it does not do, is generate intelligent behavior. For that, we need a theory of rational action. Rational thought, by itself, is not enough.</p> <p>1.4 Acting rationally: The rational agent approach</p> <p>An agent is just something that acts. Of course, all computer programs do something, but computer agents are expected to do more: operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals.</p> <p>A rational agent: act to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome</p> <p>The rational-agent approach to AI has two advantages over the other approaches.</p> <p>First, it is more general than the \u201claws of thought\u201d approach because correct inference is just one of several possible mechanisms for achieving rationality.</p> <p>Second, it is more amenable to scientific development. The standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and completely general. We can often work back from this specification to derive agent designs that provably achieve it-something that is largely impossible if the goal is to imitate human behavior or thought processes.</p> <p>The problem of achieving agreement between our true preferences and the objective we put into the machine is called the value alignment problem: the values or objectives put into the machine must be aligned with those of the human. If we are developing an AI system in the lab or in a simulator\u2014as has been the case for most of the field\u2019s history\u2014there is an easy fix for an incorrectly specified objective: reset the system, fix the objective, and try again. As the field progresses towards increasingly capable intelligent systems that are deployed in the real world, this approach is no longer viable. A system deployed with an incorrect objective will have negative consequences. Moreover, the more intelligent the system, the more negative the consequences.</p> <p>There is good reason, then, to think that the standard model is inadequate. We don\u2019t want machines that are intelligent in the sense of pursuing their objectives; we want them to pursue our objectives. If we cannot transfer those objectives perfectly to the machine, then we need a new formulation\u2014one in which the machine is pursuing our objectives, but is necessarily uncertain as to what they are. When a machine knows that it doesn\u2019t know the complete objective, it has an incentive to act cautiously, to ask permission, to learn more about our preferences through observation, and to defer to human control. Ultimately, we want agents that are provably beneficial to humans.</p>"},{"location":"deployment/markdown-deployment/","title":"MkDocs","text":"<p>1- Install MkDocs locally:</p> <pre><code>pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material\n</code></pre> <p>** verify the installation:</p> <pre><code>mkdocs --version\n</code></pre> <p>2- Add mkdocs.yml to root folder:</p> <pre><code>site_name: Fonij Dev Notes\nsite_description: \"Fonij developer cheatsheets &amp;
